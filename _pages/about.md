Welcome to my homepage!

I'm currently a senior undergraduate student at Central University of Finance and Economics. And I'm going to pursue a PhD in Econ at Peking University.

My pre-PhD research interest includes labor, health and politics. Moreover, due to my finance major, I'm also familiar with corporate finance.

I'm seeking opportunities for collaboration with smart guys. If you could allow me to join your projects, or you'd like to join my projects, feel free to contact me at wmdplato@163.com 


# üìù Publications 

1. **Pollution, Information and Migration** Asian Development Review, Accepted. First Author & Corresponding Author. (With my RA Zikun Ding. Zikun is my classmate, friend and research assistant.)
- Abstract: This study exploits the staggered roll-out of a landmark air quality monitoring program in China to study the migration response to pollution information disclosure and labor market outcomes. Using two nationally representative individual-level datasets, we show that information mitigates the negative pollution-settlement relationship, contrary to intuition. These results are attributable to information effects‚Äîincreased life satisfaction from information accessibility and environmental governance‚Äîand health effects, including improved health conditions and reduced hospital costs. Further evidence suggests income growth is more pronounced for individuals with better Internet or mobile device access and in regions with stronger economic development and healthcare resources. We also rule out alternative explanations related to labor supply and selection issues. Our findings highlight the benefits of improving public access to pollution information in developing economies where information blockades are widespread.

# üìù Pre-PhD Working Papers 

1. **How Does Capital Market Respond to Justice? Judicial Reform in China** Under Review at Journal of Comparative Economics. Single Author.
- Abstract: I exploit the progressive roll-out of a landmark judicial reform in China to examine the effects of judicial justice on investors‚Äô attitudes. The results suggest that the reform raises the trust from investors. This is because decoupling of judiciary and administrative power reduces protectionism and distortion in judicial decisions where incentives for intervention are strong, as well as enhances the enthusiasm and effectiveness of media, analysts and managements in disclosure, improving the firms‚Äô information environments. The positive effects are stronger for firms non state-owned, bank-dependent and lack of government support. The reform further improves the price informativeness and reduces the crash risk, excluding the alternative explanation for noise traders. My findings highlight the positive externality of judicial justice and demonstrate that fighting the remnants of protectionism and administrative overreach can effectively promote the development of the capital market.
